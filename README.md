# CA1 aka Tricolor Adventure

Press escape key to quit game.

Tricolor adventure wants to be a puzzle platformer inspired by indie game Hue and mobile phone Color Switch.
The basic idea behind the game and its main mechanic is that the player can change colours through collecting floating coloured coins. 
There are 3 types of coins: Blue, Yellow & Red. Same can be said for the obstacles in the game.
The player has the ability to pass through the objects that share his colour.
The remaining 2 ( white does not count) will kill the player upon collision.

This repository's default branch is not 'main' but 'new-aproach'. That's because in coding the colour switch mechanic I got stuck in the original aproach and decided to scrap it.
However, not wanting to lose all the work I put into the old code I decided to continue on a different branch called 'new-aproach'. If you'd like to see the old playerColourChanger script check out the old 'main' branch.
